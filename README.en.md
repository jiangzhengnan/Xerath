Xerath is a Gradle Transform with [custom annotations]+[ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) +[Gradle Transform API](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/transform-api)
Implementation of a powerful set of Android Aop framework, easy to develop, and can effectively reduce duplication of code. 

The compiler is designed to make global changes to fulfill special requirements such as method time statistics, exception collection, interception, dynamic proxies, and so on. 

The core idea is based on AOP Programming, AOP is the abbreviation of Aspect Oriented Programming, meaning: Aspect Oriented Programming. 

This project for the use of AOP thought on Android and actual combat, functions of the standard part aspectj-based open source projects [AopArms] (https://github.com/AICareless/AopArms) < br / >
ðŸ”§ continuous development, welcome to build!

### Get started
Clone this project to the local, in the root directory to open the terminal to execute the following command, you can successfully run! 

```
sh upload.sh
```


### introduction method
Once you upload to Maven, you can now actively rely on XerathLib for your own projects. 


### Feature List (in addition)
<img src="https://github.com/jiangzhengnan/Xerath/blob/master/app/src/main/res/raw/ic_func.jpg" width="30%">


### Instructions
1. Limit method calls to 
 frequently
Add the @xerath_limitCall (time = 1000L) annotation to the target method, where time is the time threshold for frequent calls. 

```
@Xerath_LimitCall(time = 1000L)
public static void doubleClick() {
//do something
}
```

 

Add the @xerath_trycatch annotation to the target method. 

```
@TryCatch
public static void tryCatchMethod() {
int a = 1 / 0;
}
```


Add @xerath_methodremove annotation to the target method, where removeMethods pass in the target method to be removed. 

```
@Xerath_MethodRemove(
removeMethods = {
"android/util/Log|d|(Ljava/lang/String; Ljava/lang/String;) I",
"android/widget/Toast|makeText|(Landroid/content/Context; Ljava/lang/CharSequence; I)Landroid/widget/Toast;" .
"android/widget/Toast|()V"
}
)
public static void tryRemoveMethod(Context context) {
Log.d("nangua","nangua");
Toast.makeText(context,"",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
```
4. The pop-up Toast < br / >
Add the @xerath_poptoast annotation to the target method, where STR is the content of the Toast that needs to be displayed. 

```
@xerath_poptoast (STR = "test Toast")
public static void popToast() {
//do something
}
```
5. Statistical method time-consuming 

Add the @xerath_calculateTime annotation to the target method. 

```
@CalculateTime
public static void CalculateTimeMethod() {
//do something
}
```


 

Add the @xerath_CollectParams annotation to the target method. 

```
@Xerath_CollectParams
public static String testParams(boolean boolParam, byte byteParam, char charParam, short shortParam, int intParam,  long longParam,
float floatParam, double doubleParam, String stringParam, int[] intArrParam, JSONObject json) {
String result = boolParam + " " + byteParam + " " + charParam + " " + shortParam + " " + intParam + " " +
longParam + " " + floatParam + " " + doubleParam + " " + stringParam + " " + intArrParam.length + json.toString();
return result;
}
```


 


8. Call link statistics 

Add the @xerath_callchain annotation to the target method that needs to trace the calling link. 

```
@Xerath_CallChain
public void doSomeThing() {
//do something
}
```
